EC2 Instances Pra

Hello Everyone,
   Welcome all here, It's my first EC2 Instance Pra it was just a small practical or hands on.
First of all i have login to AWS concole home page in home page there was a services icon.
In the services i have clicked on Instances because i wanted to create an Instance.
In the Instance i have clicked on Launch Instance the page pop up which we need to fill all the required information or details like, Name and tags AWS1 which i have provided the name.
After that we have application and os images so we need to choose a wide range of operating system that aws provided, you can choose any of them i have choosed Ubuntu because it is widely used in the DevOps Community.
We need to choose the instance type which is free tier which is very important also you can choose other option but it has certain subscriptions which is provided by aws, but in free tier there are some limited resources.
After that we have Key pair we need to provide some key by clicking on create new key pair in simple words it will be your password, after you click on create key pair it will be automatically downloaded and saved on your local it is very useful.
After generating key pair the rest of the configuration kept by default because we have created an instance just for practice purpose.
Click on launch instance.
Wait for few minutes it will automatically create your instance.
You can see instance has been created.
