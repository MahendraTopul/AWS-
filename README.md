EC2 Instance Hands-on

Hello Everyone,

Welcome..!! Today, I created my first **EC2 Instance** on AWS as hands-on exercise.

1. **Login to AWS Console**: Navigated to the **Services** section and clicked on **Instances** to start creating an instance.
2. **Launch Instance**: Clicked on **Launch Instance** and filled in the required details:
   - **Name and Tags**: Named it **AWS1**.
   - **Application and OS Images**: Selected **Ubuntu** for its popularity in the DevOps community.
   - **Instance Type**: Chose the **free tier** for cost efficiency.
   - **Key Pair**: Created a new key pair (acts as your password), which was automatically downloaded for future access.

3. **Launch**: Kept the rest of the configurations as default and clicked **Launch Instance**.
